Default skin is "skin_C.zip".

Skin A just lists the buttons in alphabetical + GC controller order.
Skin B does the same as skin A, but switches top and middle row.
Skin C tries to copy the real GC layout for main buttons ABXY LRZS.
Skin D tries to copy the real GC layout for D-Pad and buttons.


To change, simply extract your desired skin into the folder (and overwrite).
