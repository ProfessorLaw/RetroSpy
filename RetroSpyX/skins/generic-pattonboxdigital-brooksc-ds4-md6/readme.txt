Description             : This skin is for displaying controller inputs from a
                          DualShock 4-based Patton Box Digital controller when
                          used with a Brook PS3/PS4 to Mega Drive/PC Engine
                          Super Converter on a Sega Mega Drive. (This Brook
                          Super Converter can be connected to both a Mega Drive
                          or a PC Engine and a PC simultaneously, obviating the
                          need for a controller input capture device.)
